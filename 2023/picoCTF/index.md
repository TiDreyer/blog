# picoCTF 2023

The [picoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/) is an annual CTF organized by the Carnegie Mellon University.
It is aimed at US students from middle school to undergrad levels and regarded as a good beginner CTF.
The challenges cover a wide range of topics and are sorted into six categories:

- Binary Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Forensics
- General Skills
- Reverse Engineering
- Web Exploitation

I participated in the 2023 picoCTF under the name [t03r](https://play.picoctf.org/users/t03r).
During the 14-day contest from 2023-03-14 to 2023-03-28,
I solved 38 out of the 47 challenges and earned 6400 out of 9300 possible points,
which put me on place 133 out of 6924 participant on the global score board.

Below are write-ups for some of the challenges I found particularly interesting.
